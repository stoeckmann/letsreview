# Scaling Code Review Groups

Our idea of code review groups is that people actively work together.
This implies that everyone contributes by leading a review or adding
feedback.

## Vertical Scaling

If a group scales vertically, then more and more members join. Huge
groups cannot operate as flexible as small ones and it becomes more
and more difficult to integrate everyone into active roles.

Eventually not everyone can actively contribute anymore. You can try
to compensate this by splitting members into active contributors to
a session and a more passive audience. One possibility is to share a
screen and video session with active contributors and stream the
whole channel through a streaming platform. The audience can still
follow the session and add live feedback through chat. Consider adding
moderators to the chat to push questions to the active group and
for audience management.

But even with all these techniques the vertical scaling does not work
well. Too many people are forced to follow a process defined by the
active group, who force their way of performing a review and adding
"blind spots" by forcing the audience to follow their thought
patterns.

## Horizontal Scaling

Splitting groups if too many members join is a way to horizontally
scale. People can keep their mode of operation without additional
technical or organizational overhead.

Exchanging ideas and new techniques between groups has to be managed
in addition to sessions. One such possibility is writing a blog,
exchanging meeting minutes or if people occasionally join other groups
to share their experiences.
