# Forming a Group

So you want to form a group but are unsure which format fits best or
which obstacles might lie in front of you? Then let's review some
possible concepts and how they differ.

It is best to imagine the kind of group you want to be part of. Subtle
differences at core aspects could otherwise disappoint you or others.

The following core aspects should be considered.

## Visibility

Do you want to have a safe space? Or do you want others to learn from
your group's type of operation? Let's call these concepts "private" and
"public".

### private

A private group has no form of publicity. People outside of the group
might know that it exists but do not know how it internally operates.
Maybe it's not even known who exactly is part of the group. This is
an ideal setup for people who have concerns with being possibly judged
by others. People are free to express themselves during reviews and it
works great if members already know each other well. Also in case of
security relevant software it helps to responsibly disclose bugs to
maintainers before everyone knows about them by shoulder-surfing you.

### public

A public group exposes internal operations. Maybe by writing meeting
minutes, publishing videos or streaming their review sessions. This is
a great setup to expose your best practices or giving others a chance to
give your group suggestions how to improve.

## Membership

Do you want to have a fixed set of review buddies? Or do you want others
to join and leave whenever they want? Let's call these concepts "closed"
and "open".

### closed

A closed group is not open to new members. You have a fixed set of
people who perform reviews together. In such a setup it is easy for
everyone involved to get used to the way their fellow members operate
and how to integrate ideas and processes.

### open

An open group accepts members at any given time. Whoever is curious can
easily join and leave which helps to attract people to your group. Also
it has huge potential that new concepts are introduced by newcomers.

## Goal

What do you want to achieve with your group? Do you want to improve
reviewing skills? Or do you want to use your reviewing skills to fix
bugs or earn money through bug bounty programs? Let's call these
concepts "learning" and "performing".

### learning

A learning group has a strong focus on sharing knowledge among its
members. Experienced reviewers can share their setups and thought
processes with others or simply try new ones. As long as at least one
person learned something during a session, it is considered to be a
success.

### performing

A performing group has a strong focus on finding bugs. All members
should be able to contribute to this goal, and gaining knowledge is the
responsibility of an individual. This setup works great if you want to
either contribute to software projects or gain inherent knowledge of
software internals: The product is the focus, not the group members.

## Examples

Let's combine these concepts to see how such groups can operate.

### private closed learning

Imagine a course at school or university. People explicitly join such
a group to learn a subject. Students do not change during course and the
materials used are not public to everyone.

The lifetime of such a group is limited by definition. As soon as all
students are done with the lectures and exercises, the course ends.
This eventually happens to the group as well. Keep this in mind and do
not consider this approach to be a failure if the group is gone!

### public open learning

Such a group can be compared with a sitcom. No matter at which episode
you are, it must be relatively easy to join or else it does not work.
Just like with a sitcom you should not expect a lot of depth to be seen
during a session. It is best to broadly enter a subject and either
repeat this with each session or switch subjects every time to keep it
interesting to newcomers and regular members.

### private closed performing

This would be your regular company setting. Add a CEO and you are done.

## Further Considerations

Think about the amount of time you want to spend. Do you want to have
a regular schedule? How often do you want to meet? And which software
do you want to review? Do you want to advertise your group?

Even though this sounds complicated, it is best to reach out to others
and see after a few meetups if a common ground can be found.
